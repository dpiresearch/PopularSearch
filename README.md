Popular Search
==============

This was a project that tries to find keywords used in search queries that result in product page views.  The keywords are collected and scored to produce a set of "popular search" terms.  These terms in turn are used in auto complete applications, suggestions for users on categorical and product detail pages.  In other words, whatever helps the user find what he/she came looking for and keeping them engaged on the site.

Popular Search
==============

This was a project I did several years ago that tries to find keywords used in search queries that result in product page views.  The keywords are collected and scored to produce a set of "popular search" terms.  These terms in turn are used in auto complete applications as well as suggestions for users on categorical and product detail pages.  In other words, whatever helps the user find what he/she came to the site looking for and keeping them engaged.

Currently I only have the initial pieces of code checked in as I still have to scrub the rest. Overall, there about 20 - 30 pig and shell scripts along with java udf's, Azakaban config files and reference data.  Eventually they'll all make it in.

For starters, you can check out the README in src/main/hadoop/pig
